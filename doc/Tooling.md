Dev Tooling
===========

## Language Server (ccls or clangd work well)

If you use an editor with language server support, (e.g. vim, VSCode), then the
`compile_commands.json` file generated by meson (and symlinked at the root) will
be very useful to you. It should enable completion, jump to definition, etc.

It really makes it feel like you're programming in 2020.

## Commit Hooks

This repo uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to automatically run a code
formatter. Be sure to install the pre-commit tool, and then use
`pre-commit install` to add the hooks to your git checkout.

## Updating Libraries

Use `meson subprojects update` to update the version of git dependencies (like
the sc-libs). If you need a new feature, be sure to pin a minimum version in the
`meson.build` file.
