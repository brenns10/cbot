Changelog
=========

Unreleased
----------

* Added dependency on sc-regex, migrated plugins onto it.
* Added dependency on sc-collections, migrated log plugin onto it.
* Removed libstephen dependency from plugins!
* Updated plugin API:
  - Plugins may directly call functions listed in cbot.h, rather than using a
    function pointer. The function pointer struct is removed from the API.
  - Plugins no longer need to use the `addressed()` (or `cbot_addressed()`)
    function to determine whether a message is addressed to them. They may
    simply subscribe to the `CBOT_ADDRESSED` message type.
  - Plugins no longer need to compile and execute their own regular expressions.
    They may be provided within `cbot_register()` and will be executed by the
    bot itself. Handlers will be called only if the regular expression matches.

0.1.0 (2020-02-05)
