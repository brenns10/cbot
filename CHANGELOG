0.4.0 (2021-09-06)
------------------

A ton more changes. Up to this point, cbot really hasn't had a real version
scheme or release system. However, this release changes that. I'm preparing cbot
to be deployed via container, and so I want to package it for Alpine. This
requires that I have regular source tarball releases. Each release tarball
contains all necessary subprojects bundled, to make it easy to build offline and
by verifying a single checksum.

Here's a selection of changes included in the release:

* Add sc-lwt and begin using lightweight threads. Plugins and other code can
  launch a background thread to do some I/O without blocking the main thread.
* Add sqlite database integration, allowing state to be saved. We also add a DB
  API to simplify this.
* Add curl integration which allows us to query APIs in plugins.
* Add a super bare-bones Signal backend. This should be considered very alpha
  quality.

0.3.0 (2020-05-07)
------------------

* Skip 0.2.0 due to inconsistency between meson.build and CHANGELOG
* Added dependency on sc-regex, migrated plugins onto it.
* Added dependency on sc-collections, migrated log plugin onto it.
* Added dependency on sc-argparse, migrated bot runner to use it.
* Removed libstephen dependency from the project!
* Updated plugin API:
  - Plugins may directly call functions listed in cbot.h, rather than using a
    function pointer. The function pointer struct is removed from the API.
  - Plugins no longer need to use the `addressed()` (or `cbot_addressed()`)
    function to determine whether a message is addressed to them. They may
    simply subscribe to the `CBOT_ADDRESSED` message type.
  - Plugins no longer need to compile and execute their own regular expressions.
    They may be provided within `cbot_register()` and will be executed by the
    bot itself. Handlers will be called only if the regular expression matches.
* Added "become" plugin

0.1.0 (2020-02-05)
------------------

* Migrated build system to Meson, began versioning and recording changelog.
* This release was labeled 0.2.0 in the meson.build file
